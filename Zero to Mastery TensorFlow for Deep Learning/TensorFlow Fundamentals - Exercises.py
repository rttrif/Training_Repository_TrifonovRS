# Раздел 2: Deep Learning and TensorFlow Fundamentals
# ===================================================

# 1. Create a vector, scalar, matrix and tensor with values of your choosing using tf.constant().
# 2. Find the shape, rank and size of the tensors you created in 1.
# 3. Create two tensors containing random values between 0 and 1 with shape [5, 300].
# 4. Multiply the two tensors you created in 3 using matrix multiplication.
# 5. Multiply the two tensors you created in 3 using dot product.
# 6. Create a tensor with random values between 0 and 1 with shape [224, 224, 3].
# 7. Find the min and max values of the tensor you created in 6 along the first axis.
# 8. Created a tensor with random values of shape [1, 224, 224, 3] then squeeze it to change the shape to [224, 224, 3].
# 9. Create a tensor with shape [10] using your own choice of values, then find the index which has the maximum value.
# 10. One-hot encode the tensor you created in 9.
